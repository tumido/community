# WG Data Science Meetup Transfer

## Scope

The goal of this working group is to manage the smooth and successful transfer of the assets and processes for running the [Operate First Data Science Community Meetup](https://github.com/operate-first/operate-first-data-science-community) from the Open Services Group to the Operate First organization.

### In scope

* Documenting current process
* Mentoring initial incoming meetup manager(s)
* Transferring ownership of assets, such as repo's and calendar invites, etc.



## Deliverables

* Continued bi-weekly cadence of the meetup event, uninterrupted by the transition. Complete ownership of meetup by the Operate First community.

## Stakeholders

* SIG Communications

## Disband criteria

When all assets and responsibilities for running the meet up are transferred over to the Operate First org such that the stakeholder SIG members are able to run the meetup without input or support from the Open Services Group, they may decide to disband this WG.
