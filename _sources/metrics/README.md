# Community Metrics

This folder contains documents, Jupyter notebooks and other relvant information related to Operate First Community metrics.

By gleaning information from open source-ecosystem data sets such as GitHub data, we can help drive community and business-oriented decision making. Using data-analysis tools such as Jupyter notebooks, as well as community metric tools from [Project CHAOSS](https://github.com/chaoss/augur), we can enable contributors and participants to ask questions and make data-informed decisions about the Operate First community.

## Metrics

In order to measure and gauge the growth of the Operate First community, we need to define and track relevant metrics. Some of the metrics we woud like to track are:

1. **Community Vitality** - All the metrics that can be used to measure both the **size** and **growth** of the community such as number of users, number of contributors, number of projects deployed on Operate First, how many new users do we onboard every month, number of issues submitted over time, number of PRs merged over time etc.
2. **Impact** - Metrics that can be used to understand the impact made by the Operate First community such as how many upstream issues were opened, upstream contributions etc

Below are some of the metrics we would like to track:
