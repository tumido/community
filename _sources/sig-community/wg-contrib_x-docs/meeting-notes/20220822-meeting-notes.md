### Agenda and Notes:
- Name change of the group
  - check and/ or change charter?
  - As closing WG task, open up the discussion about forming "Docs SIG"
  - Proposals: 
    - "Documentation WG"
    - "New User Docs WG"
    - "User and Contributor Docs WG"
    - "~~User and Contributor Handbook WG~~" (too limiting, as READMEs etc. are location-based and not in a single handbook)
    - "New User and Contributor Docs WG"
    - "Community Cloud User Guide WG"
    - Plain plan forward:
      1. Rename to "Docs WG"
      1. Announce to everyone we are adding to the scope so the group can exit into the Docs SIG
      1. Meetings include time to talk about general docs topics
      1. WG has two key focuses to finish:
         1. Create or improve new user/contributor documentation
         1. Draft the Docs SIG charter
- Finish and publish meeting notes
